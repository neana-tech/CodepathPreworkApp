MY App Idea

The app I want to build is a price-tracking app designed for individuals with Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free products are often expensive and not easily accessible. This app would allow users to search for gluten-free items, compare prices across different stores, and track discounts or sales. It could include features like user reviews for products, a barcode scanner to check if an item is gluten-free, and a personal shopping list to manage frequently purchased items. Additionally, the app could notify users of price drops or new products in their area, helping them save money and make informed choices.
